    "In the case of a purchase mortgage loan, the ratio is obtained by dividing the original mortgage loan amount on the note date plus any secondary mortgage loan amount disclosed by the Seller by the lesser of the mortgaged propertyâs appraised value on the note date or its purchase price.  In the case of a refinance mortgage loan, the ratio is obtained by dividing the original mortgage loan amount on the note date plus any secondary mortgage loan amount disclosed by the Seller by the mortgaged propertyâs appraised value on the note date.  If the secondary financing amount disclosed by the Seller includes a home equity line of credit, then the CLTV calculation reflects the disbursed amount at closing of the first lien mortgage loan, not the maximum loan amount available under the home equity line of credit.  In the case of a seasoned mortgage loan, if the Seller cannot warrant that the value of the mortgaged property has not declined since the note date, Freddie Mac requires that the Seller must provide a new appraisal value, which is used in the CLTV calculation.  In certain cases, where the Seller delivered a loan to Freddie Mac with a special code indicating additional secondary mortgage loan amounts, those amounts may have been included in the CLTV calculation.    \n",
